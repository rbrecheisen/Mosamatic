This page allows you to select a task that processes or analyzes one or more uploaded filesets.<br>
<br>
The top half of the page lists the tasks available in Mosamatic. The bottom half shows a list of
running, canceled or completed task <i>instances</i>, if applicable. When you select a task, you will
be taken to the task's parameter page. Please refer to such a page for more help information. To 
summarize, each task's parameter page allows you to specify (1) the input fileset(s) for the task, (2)
any additional parameters to be configured before the task is executed and (3) an optional name for 
the resulting task's output fileset. There can be only one output fileset for the task's output files.<br>
<br>
Each task's parameter page has its own help information.<br>
<br>
In the task instance list you can enable <b>Auto refresh</b> to automatically refresh the page every 2
seconds and thereby see the task's progress. Running tasks can be canceled by clicking the <b>[cancel]</b>
link. Completed or failed tasks can be removed by clicking the <b>[remove]</b> link. To remove all task
instances at once, click the <b>Remove all task instances</b> link. This link will only appear if there is
at least once task instance available (either running, completed or failed).
