This is the main page of Mosamatic.<br>
<br>
Its main purpose is to upload and view filesets. A fileset is a collection of files. Each fileset has a 
unique ID and a name. The name does not have to be unique but to distinguish filesets it's best to choose
a unique name.<br>
<br>
<h5>Uploading a single fileset</h5>
Files can be uploaded in two different ways: (1) as a single fileset and (2) as multiple filesets. To upload 
a single fileset, you click <b>Choose Files</b> and navigate to the <i>directory</i> containing the files you
wish to upload. Please be aware, that ALL files in this directory will be uploaded to Mosamatic. You cannot 
upload individual files. The reason Mosamatic only supports directory upload is because this allows uploading 
multiple directories (e.g., each containing files for a given imaging scan), resulting in multiple filesets.<br>
<br>
To upload files into a single fileset, make sure to <i>enable</i> the <b>Store files as single fileset</b> checkbox.
Click <b>Choose Files</b> and select the directory containing the files in question. You can provide a name for
the fileset. If you don't, a name will be generated automatically.<br>
Once the files are uploaded (an animated icon will be shown while the upload is in progress), the fileset will 
appear below the <b>Upload</b> button. You can click the fileset name to view the contents of the fileset, i.e.,
the set of individual files.<br>
<br>
To remove a fileset from Mosamatic, click the <b>[delete]</b> link to the right of the fileset. To remove all 
filesets at once, click the <b>Delete all filesets</b> link just below the <b>Upload</b> button.<br>
<br>
<h5>Uploading multiple filesets</h5>
To upload multiple filesets at once, e.g., to upload multiple CT scans, make sure you <i>disable</i> the
<b>Store files as single fileset</b> checkbox. Then click <b>Choose Files</b> and navigate to the TOP-LEVEL directory
containing subdirectories for each scan's files. See below for the expected directory structure:<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        Top-level directory
        <ul>
            <li>
                Scan 1
                <ul>
                    <li>File 1</li>
                    <li>File 2</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Scan 2</li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
The multi-fileset upload is primarily designed for upload of multiple DICOM scans. The upload procedure automatically
detects which image belongs to which scan and creates a separate fileset for each scan. The name of the fileset will 
be based on the scan file's directory. So, in the above directory structure, the filesets will be named <b>Scan 1</b>,
<b>Scan 2</b>, etc.
