This task can be used to automatically detect muscle and fat regions in CT images acquired at the L3 vertebral level.
It takes two input filesets: (1) the DICOM images to be analyzed and (2) the AI model files to be used for segmenting
muscle and fat tissue.<br>
<br>
The AI model files are represented by just another fileset so they have to be uploaded beforehand in the Filesets page.
There are 3 model files:<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>AI model that detects abdominal contour</li>
    <li>AI model for muscle/fat</li>
    <li>Parameter file (.json)</li>
</ul>
The contour model is used to detect and extract only the abdomen, thereby ignoring possible arms and external devices
that may be visible in the L3 image. This can sometimes happen in images of trauma patients. In most CT scans, the arms
are kept above the patient's head and are not visible.<br>
<br>
The main AI model detects muscle and fat regions at L3. It classifies the image as consisting of 4 regions: (1) muscle,
(2) visceral fat, (3) subcutaneous fat and (4) background (everything else).<br>
<br>
The parameter file contains some technical configuration parameters for the AI models. You don't need to woryry about 
these parameters as long as the .json file is there.<br>
<br>
This task takes some time to execute. Initializing the graphics hardware may take a few seconds. Processing each L3 
images takes about 1-2 seconds so if you have 100 images you may have to wait about 1-2 minutes. Enable the <b>Auto refresh</b>
checkbox to see live progress updates. For more details you can go to the <b>Logs</b> page by clicking the corresponding link
in the top-left of the page. You need to refresh this page to see logging updates.<br>

After the task finishes, the segmentations will be stored in the output fileset for this task. The segmentation files cannot
be viewed directly (either online or offline) but can be converted to PNG images using the <b>CreatePngsFromSegmentationsTask</b>
task. As explained in that task's help information, the segmentation files are Python NumPy array objects. Useful for further
processing but not for easy viewing.
