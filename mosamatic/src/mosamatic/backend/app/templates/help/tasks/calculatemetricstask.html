This task can be used to calculate body composition metrics for a set of L3 and T4 images. It takes two
input filesets: (1) the fileset with L3 (or T4) images and (2) the fileset containing the muscle and fat
segmentations extracted by the <b>MuscleFatSegmentationL3Task</b> or <b>MuscleFatSegmentationT4Task</b>.<br>
<br>
The task works by overlaying each segmentation image on top of the corresponding L3 or T4 image, thereby 
knowing which image pixels correspond to which segmentation region. It can then calculate the surface area
of each segmentation region as well as the mean gray value (in Hounsfield units) of the pixels in each 
segmentation region.<br>
<br>
You can optionally also provide a fileset that contains a single comma-separated value (CVS) file that contains,
for each L3 or T4 file, the patient's height in meters. This fileset needs to be uploaded in the Filesets page.
If this fileset is provided, the CalculateMetrics task can calculate index values for each L3 or T4 image, i.e., 
the surface area of the segmentation regions divided by the patient's height squared.
