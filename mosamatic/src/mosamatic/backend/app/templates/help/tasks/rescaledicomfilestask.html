This task can be used to rescale (if necessary) DICOM images that are not 512 by 512 pixels. Mosamatic
requires images to be 512 x 512 pixels for body composition analysis. If they are not, and this happens
sometimes, they need to be rescaled.<br>
<br>
For example, sometimes CT images are wider than usual to capture the full abdominal anatomy of the patient
especially if the patient is obese (which occurs more and more often). In that case, the images could be
512 x 768 pixels or even 1024 x 1024 pixels.<br>
<br>
If the image's width is greater that its height, it first must be converted to a square image by adding
zero's (black pixels) to it. For example, an image of 512 x 700 pixels will get a band of black pixels
288 x 700 pixels added to it. This will result in a new image 700 x 700 pixels. The addition of the 
black band of pixels will cause the patient's anatomy to move to the upper half of the image somewhat. After
this enlargement, the image can now be downscaled to 512 x 512. This will, overall, decrease the size of 
the visible anatomy somewhat but we do not expect large deviations in the calculated body composition metrics
(surface area and mean gray value) as calculated by the <b>CalculateMetricsTask</b> task.<br>
<br>
Rescaled images will be stored in the output fileset under the same name but with <b>_rescaled.dcm</b> at the
end so they are easily recognized. Images that were already 512 x 512 will be unchanged and copied to the
output fileset as-is.<br>
<br>
When you run the <b>MuscleFatSegmentationL3Task</b> or <b>MuscleFatSegmentationT4Task</b> tasks on the DICOM
images make sure you select the fileset with the <i>rescaled</i> image and not the original one!
