This task can be used to automatically select L3 or T4 slices from a set of abdominal or thoracic CT scans.
Previously, Mosamatic required these images to be pre-selected from full CT scans. This is rather time-
consuming so we created a task that does this automatically.<br>
<br>
This task uses the open-source tool Total Segmentator (Wasser et al.) to first segment the vertebral spine
and the individual vertebrae. It will then select either the L3 or T4 vertebra and determine the DICOM slice
that goes right through the middle of these vertebrae. The resulting L3 or T4 images will be stored in the
output fileset and, from there, can be used in any subsequent tasks like the <b>MuscleFatSegmentationL3Task</b> task.<br>
<br>
Since this task can handle multiple CT scans at once, you can select multiple filesets as input. For this click the 
first fileset in the list and, while holding down the Ctrl key, select other filesets you wish to include. You can
also select the first and last by holding the Shift key. Or press Ctrl+A to select all filesets. Then click the 
<b>Add selected</b> button to add the filesets to the area below the button. These will be the filesets included in
the slice selection task.<br>
Then select the <b>Vertebral level</b>. This can be L3 or T4 (other levels will be added in the future). Optionally,
provide an output fileset name, and click <b>Run task</b>.
