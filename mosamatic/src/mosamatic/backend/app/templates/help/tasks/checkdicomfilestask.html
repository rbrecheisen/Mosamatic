This task can be used to check whether each DICOM image in your fileset is truly 2-dimensional or
has a 3rd dimension in each pixel. The latter case can occur when DICOM images have been loaded into
MicroDicom viewer. More recent versions of this tool seems to convert the DICOM images to another 
DICOM type where each pixel represents a <i>color</i> instead of a <i>gray value</i>. Color pixels consist of 3 elements,
red (R), green (G) and blue (B), hence the extra dimension in the DICOM image. These images cannot be
used by Mosamatic for body composition analysis so to prevent errors downstream it can be wise to check
the dimenionality of the DICOM images using this task.<br>
<br>
Simply specify which image fileset the task should use.<br>

After running the task, if there are issues with the images, a file called errors.txt will be created and
stored in the output fileset for this task. This error file will list all image files that do not have the
correct dimension.
