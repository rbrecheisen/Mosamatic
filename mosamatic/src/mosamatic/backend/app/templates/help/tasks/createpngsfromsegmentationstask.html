This task can be used to generate PNG images for a set of segmentation files that were created by the
<b>MuscleFatSegmentationL3Task</b> or <b>MuscleFatSegmentationT4Task</b> tasks. The output format of
these segmentations can be easily viewed (these are Python NumPy array objects) but can be converted
to PNG format for easy viewing. That is what this task does. The files in the output fileset can be 
viewed directly in the browser.<br>
<br>
The input fileset for this task is a fileset with segmentation outputs that was obtained from previous
tasks like <b>MuscleFatSegmentationL3Task</b> or <b>MuscleFatSegmentationT4Task</b>.
