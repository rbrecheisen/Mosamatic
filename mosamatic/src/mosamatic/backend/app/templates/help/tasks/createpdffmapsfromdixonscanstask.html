This task can be used to create a so-called Proton Density Fat Fraction (PDFF) map from a single 
Dixom MRI scan. The name seems to imply that the task can do this for multiple Dixon MRI scans but
this has not been implemented yet.<br>
<br>
The input fileset for this task should be a list of DICOM images that together comprise the DIXON scan.
Each Dixon scan consists of multiple DICOM series. Normally, each series would represent a separate scan and
this is also true for Dixon but these scans belong together and contain different data. For example, Dixon
images commonly consist of a (1) an in-phase (IP) image, (2) an opposite-phase (OP) image and (3) a water image. The latter
contains pixels that represent water content in the image. The PDFF map that this task calculates contains pixels
or voxels that represent the fat content in the image, or specifically the percentage of fat in each pixel. This
data is not available by default but can be calculated from the IP and OP images.<br>
<br>
The output filesets for this task are (1) the PDFF map and (2) a single PNG image showing visually the fat 
distribution in the middle slice of the PDFF map. You can view this PNG image when you go to the Filesets page,
select the corresponding fileset and view its single file.
