# Changelog

## [1.1] - 16-04-2025
### Added
- DecompressDicomFilesTask
- RescaleDicomFilesTask
- MuscleFatSegmentationL3Task
- CalculateMetricsTask
- CreatePngsFromSegmenationsTask

## [1.2] - 23-04-2025
### Added
- SelectL3FromScansTask

### Updated
- RescaleDicomFilesTask: performs automatic decompression of DICOM files
- MuscleFatSegmentationL3Task: performs automatic rescaling of DICOM files
  that are not 512 x 512. Rescaled files are listed in a file rescaled.txt
  in the segmentation output fileset.

## [1.2] - 28-04-2025
### Updated
- MuscleFatSegmentationL3Task: no longer performs automatic rescaling of
  DICOM images because the CalculateMetricsTask requires both the original
  images as well as the segmentation output. If this task creates a
  rescaled copy of the original images, then the dimensions of the original
  images will no longer match the dimensions of the segmentations. This
  will cause problems for the CalculateMetricsTask which requires both the
  original images and segmentations.

## [1.3] - 28-04-2025
### Added
- REST API for running tasks from the command line
